Assignment2, IN3110, Espen Hagen, espenwha

Welcome to my assignment2, and thank you for reviewing my work!

My submitted project consists of 3 files:
README.md - this file
array_class.py - containing the class 'Array'
test_array.py - tests for the class 'Array'

The Array-class is implemented for one- and two dimentional Arrays.

test_array.py can be run in the terminal using the command 'pytest' if
the pytest-package is installed, or run with the command 'python3 pytest.py'.

In order to use the Array class, the file array_class.py must be stored in the
same directory as the python-file it is to be used in.
Import the Array class to another the python file like this:

from array_class import Array
